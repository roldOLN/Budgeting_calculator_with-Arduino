# Budgeting_calculator_with-Arduino
This project is designed to divide your budget to N number of days and then track how you spend that budget each day.

It is a compact, light-weight, and portable--keychain-like device that can track your budget on the go--hassle-free.

How it works:
    on the upper part of the display, you can see the "budget" text, next to it is your calculated balance for that day. Anything below that is where your regular computations will appear.

    To setup your budget per day, simply input your total budget, then press the upper left button to enter into the N days menu. Select the number of days you'll be spending your money. Once you selected your N days, the calculated budget per day will appear on the screen, after that you can go back to the main menu by clicking the upper left button again. To track your budget you can just type your spending and then press the button next to the upper left to subtract it on your budget. And there you have it! you can now track your budget on the go and hassle free!
